# ECON-453-PS2
This repository contains my submission for ECON-453 Problem Set 2, which involves statistical analysis using real-world data from standardized test scores and real estate markets in college towns. The project includes computing confidence intervals, performing hypothesis testing, and generating descriptive statistics. The analysis was conducted in R, applying classical frequentist statistical methods such as t-tests and confidence interval estimation to draw inferences from sample data.


-----------
Question 1
Analyze standardized test scores for randomly selected students from two schools across two
years. The data are on D2L in pset2 data.xlsx, sheet “scores”.
1. Using the data for both schools for both years, calculate a 95% confidence interval for
overall average test score.
2. Test the null hypothesis that overall average test score (for both schools and for both
years combined) is 63 against the alternative that the average is not 63. Use 5% level
of significance. What is the p-value for this test?
3. Test the null hypothesis that Adams and Kennedy have the same average scores. Use
5% level of significance. What is the p-value for this test?
Question 2
Analyze real estate from a sample of college towns. The data are in sheet “houses”.
1. Pick a university from the sample: provide summary statistics (min, max, sample mean,
sample std, and number of observations) for housing sale price in that town. Create a
table with these summary statistics.
2. Show the 95% confidence interval for the mean household price in the town you picked.
3. Test the null hypothesis that homes less than 2,000 square feet have the same average
price as homes that are 2,000 square feet or larger. Perform this test for the whole
sample and for the town you picked separately. Report the p-value of these two tests.
